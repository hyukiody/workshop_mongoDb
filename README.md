This is a project of the following online course at Udemy.com: Java COMPLETO Programação Orientada a Objetos + Projetos, lectured by Dr. Nelio Alves.

Done for purpouses practice only; the stabilization a MongoDB database as a Windows service running locally, and implementation of a NoSQL programing system. 
A program that saves simple User class objects and their Posts; with these Posts in their turn also keeping a sequence of commentaries. By direct injection,
we instante these, allowing us then, by using the app MongoDB Compass we can verify their persistence in the database.

Also, using the app Postman we fetch these objects via html query, receiving them in Json format.

Thank you for reading. Feel free to send a message or something.
